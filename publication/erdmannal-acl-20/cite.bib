 abstract = {We address Paradigm Discovery, the problem of learning an inflectional system from raw corpus data alone. Using currently available resources, we present a framework for performing and evaluating this challenging task across a variety of languages. We propose a baseline system which uses embeddings and sequence alignment to cluster word forms by paradigm membership and by morphosyntactic properties. Then it uses a transformer to predict forms to fill any empty paradigm cells. Performance is better on clustering by paradigms than by morphosyntactic properties, while cell filling is most difficult. Our analysis suggests multiple inflection classes is the most pressing challenge for future work.},
