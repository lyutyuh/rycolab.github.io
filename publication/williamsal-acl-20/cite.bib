 abstract = {The noun lexica of many natural languages are divided into several classes characterized by morphological properties. Such subdivisions can appear arbitrary, as a noun’s class cannot straightforwardly be deduced from its form or meaning alone. Despite this, loose semantic or phonological regularities can be for individual declension classes on a by-language basis. Here, we measure how much information, in bits, phonological form and/or meaning shares with declension class in Czech and German. Because form and meaning can imperfectly predict gender, and gender—as we quantitatively verify—can, in turn, provide information about declension class, we control for gender to determine how much additional information these factors share with class. We find that mutual information (MI) between class and form differs significantly from zero, as does MI between class and meaning in both languages. Tripartite MI between class, form, and meaning (given gender) is also significant. Our study is important for two reasons: first, it lends quantitative support to a classic theoretical contention in some areas of linguistics that declension class is a more fine-grained grammatical system built atop grammatical gender. Secondly, it provides evidence that form and meaning modulate the predictability of declension class to different degrees, not just by language, but also by class.},
